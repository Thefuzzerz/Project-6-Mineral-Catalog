# Project 6 Mineral Catalog
 Treehouse Django Project Mineral Catalog Application

 This application uses Django, Python, HTML, and CSS to create an application for a Mineral Catalog website.
 
 The mineral list view can be refined alphabetically or left completely open. There is also an option for display of a random mineral.
 
 The mineral detail view will omit any attribute of the model that did not have a value or was left blank. The attributes are displayed by the most commonly completed values in
 the database.
 
 The database is included completed. The database was created from the JSON file through the initialize function in models.py.
 
 Testing was completed and the coverage file included in the repository.
 
 No superuser was created as entries were created in batch and individual model adjustment not required.
